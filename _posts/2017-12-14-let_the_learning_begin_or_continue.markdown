Welcome to my Flatiron School student blog! The title of this blog is called Coder's Quandary because often I find myself in a state of just that: "perplexity or uncertainty over what to do in a difficult [insert coding scenario here]." The process of learning to code is like a ladder and each rung is a quandary that branches out into its own tree of quandaries that must then be traversed, familiarized and then mastered- hey, that sounds a bit like the DOM.

I started learning JavaScript in October 2016. Back then I had no idea what a function even was. I steered clear of all mathetmatics in college including Calculus (having successfully evaded Precalculus in highschool). I was studying psychology anyway and the most important skills to master under the umbrella of mathematics was statistics. So having long forgotten the days of computational quandary, I found myself regretting my preceding aversion. I felt I was not just starting from square one, but in fact I was starting from square -100. It was true, I had started with a great disadvantage, but this only proved to be an essential warm-up for the difficulty that lay ahead. Learning to struggle, persist and transform frustration into humility and excitement through that feeling of being far behind was just a representation of many similar situations to come. I would think any good programmer always feels at least a little bit behind because he/she knows there is always more to learn. Getting comfortable with this was key. The practice of becoming comfortable with how much I didn't know was an integral part of my journey.

I've done a lot of self-teaching over the last year and I decided I wanted to join a program that would put me on a proven path to success. The bonus of Flatiron is that I can learn another programming language (Ruby) and start to build a portfolio with a structure that illustrates best practices that I wouldn't otherwise be aware of without formal schooling.
