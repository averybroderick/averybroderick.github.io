Today it occurred to me that the majority of a programmer's tasks will require making broken code unbroken. With small, executable milestones that unbreak the system a little less by slowly being articulated line by line we can find a diamond in the rough.  

This is actually sort of a positive way of looking at it for me. It's less about building something from nothing and more about envisioning an immaculate software, knowing that the code for it already exists, and your job is just to chisel away at the extraneous logic. In the words of Michelangelo: 

> Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.
> I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.
